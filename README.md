## Service Calculator

This is a simple tool I wrote for the merchandising managers at my job. To summarize its purpose, the progress of merchandising teams is tracked by what they call a service percentage. Obviously the goal is to keep that percentage as high as possible, so they aim for a certain percentage goal but lacked any real way to define how to get there. 

This tool allows the merchandising teams to calculate exactly how many bays they need to complete to reach their target service percentage, as well as see how many employees should be allocated to the task. These completed bays become incomplete after a period of time and count against the total service percentage, so in addition I included a way to see what the negative impact for each day would be on the overall percentage.
